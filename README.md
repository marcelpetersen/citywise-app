# CityWise mobile app.
The CityWise mobile app is an easy way for city residents to submit problems they see around town to their city. Log in with Google, choose a category, pinpoint the problem on a map, upload a picture (optional) and add a quick description. Then hit submit and the issue is sent to a database your city can access to view, and fix the issues.

### Technologies.
The app was built in Ionic with a NodeJS and Express back end and a PostgreSQL database.
